      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

      <p>Video games have become one of the most dominant forms of entertainment in the twenty-first century, reaching audiences across every age group and region of the world. The global gaming industry now generates well over $180 billion annually, surpassing both the film and music industries combined. Rapid technological improvements in graphics, gameplay, and accessibility have transformed gaming into a central part of modern digital culture.</p>

      <p>One important way to evaluate a game’s success is to compare its commercial performance with its critical reception. <em>Metacritic</em> aggregates professional critic scores and user ratings, providing a valuable measure of how well a game is received by different audiences. By analyzing the relationship between total game sales and Metacritic scores, we can explore whether higher ratings tend to correspond with higher sales, or if other factors—such as platform availability, publisher reputation, or timing—play a larger role. For example, a title with an average critic score of 9<sup>5</sup> might still sell fewer copies than another with 8<sup>8</sup>, depending on its marketing and genre appeal.</p>

      <h2>2. Data</h2>

      <h3>2.1 Review Scores</h3>
      <p>The dataset includes video games released across multiple platforms, with corresponding <em>Metacritic</em> critic scores and user scores. Review scores range from 0 to 100 and represent aggregated ratings from professional critics and individual players. These ratings provide insight into the general reception of each game, serving as a useful measure of quality and popularity.</p>

      <h3>2.2 Sales Data</h3>
      <p>Sales information was collected from global sales reports, showing how many copies each game sold worldwide. The dataset also includes the publisher and platform for each title, which allows for comparisons across companies and consoles. By combining this data with review scores, patterns can be identified to determine whether games with higher ratings generally achieve stronger commercial success.</p>

      <h3>3.1 Correlation Between Review Scores and Sales</h3>
      <p>The relationship between <em>Metacritic</em> scores and global sales was analyzed to determine whether critical reception influences commercial performance. A general positive trend was observed, with higher-scoring games often achieving stronger sales. However, exceptions exist where niche genres or limited marketing led to lower sales despite strong reviews.</p>

      <h3>3.2 Platform and Publisher Trends</h3>
      <p>When comparing across platforms, PlayStation and Nintendo titles frequently received higher average review scores and sales. Major publishers like Nintendo and Activision tended to dominate top-performing games, while smaller developers succeeded by targeting specific audiences. These patterns highlight how platform popularity and brand recognition impact a game’s reach and revenue.</p>

    <section id="conclusion">
      <h2>4. Conclusion</h2>
      <p>Overall, the analysis shows a moderate relationship between <em>Metacritic</em> review scores and global video game sales. While strong critical reception can increase visibility, factors such as brand reputation, marketing, platform exclusivity, and release timing often play a more decisive role in determining success.</p>

      <p>By studying these trends, developers and publishers can make more informed decisions about pricing, promotion, and release strategies. Future research could explore player demographics or region-specific data to gain deeper insights into what drives sales performance in different markets.</p>
